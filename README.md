**`Programmer(pc/mobile/web)`**

I'm a dev programmer with focus in the Game industry. I am currently in the last year of College. In my projects I like to take the botton up approuch, fist looking at the problem that needs to be solved and then building up the design, planning up the routes we will take to get there. I like to solve difficult problems, ones I don't accuallly know the answer right away and I am always making small projetcs about intersting game mechanics
